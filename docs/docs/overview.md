## Workshop Overview

This workshop explores cutting-edge AI technologies that are transforming how businesses build intelligent applications and process data.

## Key Technologies

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
**Technical Perspective:**
- Standardized protocol for AI model communication and integration
- Enables seamless data exchange between different AI systems
- Provides consistent interfaces for model deployment and management
- Supports multi-model architectures and interoperability

**Business Perspective:**
- Reduces vendor lock-in by enabling model portability
- Accelerates AI development through standardized interfaces
- Enables rapid experimentation with different AI models
- Improves ROI through reusable AI infrastructure

### Agentic Applications
**Technical Perspective:**
- AI systems that can make autonomous decisions and take actions
- Combine large language models with external tools and APIs
- Implement reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities
- Support complex workflows and multi-step problem solving

**Business Perspective:**
- Automate complex business processes end-to-end
- Reduce manual intervention in routine decision-making
- Scale expertise across organizations through AI agents
- Enable 24/7 intelligent customer service and support

## Workshop Focus

Through hands-on exercises with the Zava DIY retail dataset, you'll learn to:

- Build and deploy MCP-compliant AI services
- Create agentic applications that can analyze data and make recommendations
- Integrate multiple AI models using standardized protocols
- Implement business logic that combines AI insights with automated actions

## Real-World Impact

By the end of this workshop, you'll understand how these technologies can transform business operations, from automating customer support to providing intelligent data analysis and decision-making capabilities.
