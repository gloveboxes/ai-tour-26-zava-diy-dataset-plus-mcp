## Solution Architecture

This section provides an architectural overview of the solution, outlining the key components, their interactions, and the overall system design.

## Architecture Overview

When documenting your solution architecture, consider including:

- **System Components**: Identify the main building blocks of your solution
- **Data Flow**: Show how information moves through the system
- **Integration Points**: Highlight how different services and components connect
- **Technology Stack**: Document the frameworks, libraries, and tools used
- **Deployment Model**: Describe how the solution is deployed and scaled
- **Security Considerations**: Outline authentication, authorization, and data protection measures

## Design Patterns

Consider documenting the architectural patterns and design principles that guide your solution:

- Microservices vs. monolithic architecture
- Event-driven architecture patterns
- Data persistence strategies
- API design and integration approaches
- Error handling and resilience patterns

## Scalability and Performance

Include considerations for:

- Horizontal and vertical scaling strategies
- Performance optimization techniques
- Caching mechanisms
- Load balancing approaches
- Monitoring and observability

This architectural documentation serves as a blueprint for understanding the solution's structure and guides both development and operational decisions.
