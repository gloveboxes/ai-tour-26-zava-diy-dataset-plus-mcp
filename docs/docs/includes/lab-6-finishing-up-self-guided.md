## Finishing Up - Self-Guided Learners

Congratulations on completing the workshop! Here's how to properly clean up your environment and continue your learning journey.

## Clean Up Your Environment

### 1. Save Your Progress
- Commit and push your changes to your forked repository:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Completed workshop exercises"
  git push origin main
  ```
- Your work is now safely saved in your GitHub repository

### 2. Stop Your GitHub Codespace
- Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
- Find your workshop Codespace
- Click the three dots (...) and select "Stop codespace"
- This prevents unnecessary usage charges

### 3. Resource Cleanup
- Delete any large model files you're not planning to use:
  ```bash
  # Example: Remove downloaded models
  rm -rf ./models/large-model-files
  ```
- Clear temporary files and caches if needed
- Keep only the code and configurations you want to reference later

### 4. Monitor Your Usage
- Check your GitHub Codespaces usage in Settings > Billing
- Free accounts have monthly limits - be mindful of your remaining hours
- Consider upgrading if you plan to do more development

## Continue Your Learning

### Next Steps
- Explore the workshop repository for additional examples
- Try implementing the concepts in a new project
- Experiment with different configurations and parameters

### Resource Management Tips
- Use Codespaces for active development only
- Stop Codespaces when taking breaks
- Consider setting up a local development environment for extended learning
