## Key Data Features

### üìä Seasonal Variations

The generator implements **Washington State seasonal multipliers** for realistic business patterns:

#### **Hand Tools**

- **Peak season**: May-August (1.4-1.6x normal volume)
- **Low season**: December (0.9x normal volume)
- **Pattern**: Spring/summer home improvement surge

#### **Power Tools**

- **Peak season**: June-July (2.0-2.1x normal volume)
- **Low season**: December-February (0.8-0.9x normal volume)
- **Pattern**: Strong summer construction activity

#### **Paint & Finishes**

- **Peak season**: April (2.2x normal volume)
- **Strong season**: March-August (1.6-2.0x normal volume)
- **Pattern**: Spring painting season with sustained summer activity

#### **Lumber & Building Materials**

- **Peak season**: June-July (2.1-2.2x normal volume)
- **Low season**: November-February (0.7-0.8x normal volume)
- **Pattern**: Construction/renovation season alignment

#### **Garden & Outdoor**

- **Extreme seasonality**: 50% of normal volume in winter
- **Peak season**: Spring through early fall
- **Pattern**: Weather-dependent outdoor activity

### üí∞ Financial Structure

#### **Margin Analysis**

- **Consistent 33% gross margin** across all products
- **Cost basis**: JSON price data represents wholesale cost
- **Selling price calculation**: Cost √∑ 0.67 = Retail Price
- **Margin verification**: Built-in reporting and validation

#### **Revenue Patterns**

- **Year-over-year growth**: Configurable growth patterns (2020-2026) with consistent business expansion
- **Growth trajectory**: Steady increases year-over-year, except for 2023 which shows a slight decline reflecting market conditions
- **Store performance variation**: Based on location and market size
- **Seasonal revenue fluctuations**: Aligned with product demand cycles

### üè™ Store Performance Characteristics

#### **High-Performance Stores**

- **Seattle**: 30% customer distribution, 3.0x order frequency, 1.3x order value
- **Bellevue**: 25% customer distribution, 2.6x order frequency, 1.2x order value
- **Online**: 30% customer distribution, 3.0x order frequency, 1.5x order value

#### **Regional Stores**

- **Tacoma**: 20% customer distribution, 2.4x order frequency, 1.1x order value
- **Spokane**: 8% customer distribution, 2.0x order frequency, 1.0x order value

#### **Specialty/Smaller Markets**

- **Everett, Redmond, Kirkland**: Lower distribution weights with adjusted multipliers
- **Geographic clustering**: Realistic market penetration patterns

### üîí Security & Access Control

#### **Row-Level Security (RLS)**

- **Store manager isolation**: Each manager sees only their store's data
- **Super manager access**: UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` bypasses all restrictions
- **Secure multi-tenancy**: Perfect for workshop and demo scenarios
- **Policy coverage**: Orders, order items, inventory, customers

#### **Manager Access Patterns**

- **Unique UUIDs** for each store manager
- **Complete data isolation** between stores
